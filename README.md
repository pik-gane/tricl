# tricl
TriCl model in C++

Dependencies
------------
* C++ language standard >=17
* rapidcsv: <https://github.com/d99kris/rapidcsv>
* zlib <https://www.zlib.net/> (instead of using the heavier and harder to install libboost_iostreams shared library)
* boost::iostreams header files: <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html> 

Installation
------------
* ``cd`` to some place
* ``git clone https://github.com/mensch72/tricl.git``
* ``cd tricl``
* ``mkdir -p build/default``
* ``cd build/default``
* if necessary, set the environmental variables CC, CXX, CPATH, LIBRARY_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your C compiler, C++ compiler, static library path, an shared library path
* ``cmake ../../``
* ``cmake --build .``
* ``cp src/tricl`` to wherever you want the binary

Usage
-----
* write some config file ``someconfigfile.yaml`` (see below)
* run model with ``tricl someconfigfile.yaml [options]`` (or first list options with ``tricl someconfigfile.yaml --help``)
* visualize or analyse output gexf-file, e.g. with gephi <https://gephi.org/>

Caution: output files might get large! Try with small ``limits:events`` first and use gexf.gz file format!

Legend to output
----------------
- logl: total log-likelihood of this realization so far
- er: current rate of events [1/time]
- ld: overall link density
- ad: overall angle density
- q: rough metric of clustering (= ad/ld²). 1 indicates a "normal level" of clustering
- t: model time
 
Config file syntax
------------------
See folder ``config_files`` for examples.
Config files use YAML <https://yaml.org/> syntax, in particular using these YAML features:
```yaml
simple key: scalar value
simple key: [list, of, values] 
[list, as, key]: value

list name:
   - list item
   - list item

map name:
   key: value
   key: value

# comment
~  # empty value
inf  # infinity
```
In addition, numerical values can not only be specified as numeric lieterals but also via simple mathematical expressions such as ``3 * sin(pi/5)^2``.

A tricl config file has this overall structure (where stuff in ``<this kind of brackets>`` is a placeholder):
```yaml
metadata: <model and simulation metadata>

files: <where to get and put stuff>
options: <...>

metaparameters: <optional definition of values to be used further down>

limits: <how long to run etc.>

entities: <specification of entity types and named entities>
relationship types: <spec. of rel.types and their inverses>

initial links:
    named: <named initial links>
    random: <spec. for random generation of initial links>
    <filename.csv>: <spec. for reading initial links from a file>

dynamics: <rules of the model dynamics>

visualization: <node and link attributes to be used by gephi>  # optional
```
These sections look like this in more detail:
```yaml
metadata:
    name: <name of the model> 
    description: 
        <some lengthier description,
        which might be several lines>
    author: <who wrote this file>
    date: <...>
    email: <...>

files:   
    gexf: <where to output the resulting temporal network>  
        # must end in either .gexf or .gexf.gz (recommended) 
    diagram prefix: <filename prefix for structural diagram output>
    # files not listed are not generated

options:
    silent:  <true or false>  # suppress all output, default: false
    logl:    <true or false>  # only output final log-likelihood, default: false
    quiet:   <true or false>  # suppress most output, default: false
    verbose: <true or false>  # increase output, default: false
    debug:   <true or false>  # output very much, default: false

metaparameters:  
    # will be substituted for their values 
    # in expressions occurring in the rest of the config file.
    # a metaparameter XY can be overwritten by specifying 
    # an option -XY <value or expression> on the command line 

    <token>: <value or expression>   # <explanation>
    <token>: <value or expression, maybe using earlier tokens>
    <token>: <value or expression, maybe using earlier tokens>

limits:
    t: <max. simulation time>  # default: .inf
    events: <max. no. of simulated events>  # default: .inf
```

    # in some cases, single-entity types are needed,

    # map of relationship type specifications.

    <relationship label>: ~  # a non-symmetric (directed) relationship type without any named inverse
    <relationship label>:

Development
-----------

To generate a local copy of the documentation:
* execute ``doxygen`` in the top repository folder
* find the documentation in the folder ``doc`` (will be ignored by git)

To profile:
```shell
   valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=callgrind.out tricl myconfig.yaml --quiet && kcachegrind callgrind.out &
```
